# Modeling-and-Simulation-of-Mechatronic-Systems
Develop a complete mathematical model of a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire actuated by an electric current and a bias spring. The operation of the SMA actuator involves different physical phenomena, such as heat transfer, phase transformation with temperature hysteresis, stressâ€“strain variations and electrical resistance variation accompanying the phase transformation. We model each of these phenomena in a modular fashion.
